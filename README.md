# Blockchain, Web3, and Solidity

## Description
This repository contains my studies and experiments with blockchain technologies, Web3, and the Solidity programming language. The goal of this project is to deepen my knowledge in these areas, create and test smart contracts, and explore different aspects of blockchain technology.

## Repository Structure
/contracts: Smart contracts written in Solidity (.sol).
/tests: Automated tests for smart contracts.

## Technologies Used
Solidity: Programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.
Web3.js: JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js
Metamask (optional, for interacting with the application on the web)
